# Project Euler 053 - Combinatoric Selections

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

    123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235. 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation 5C3 = 10.

In general, nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!), where r &le; n, n! = nx(n-1)x...x3x2x1, and 0! = 1.

It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: 23C10 = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of nCr for 1 &le; n &le; 100, are greater than one-million.
